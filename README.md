# Auto Insurance Retention Capstone

</div>

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that will identify the likelihood of customer retention based on aspects of their demographic. Identifying aspects of customer demographics associated with increased retention will help to guide an insurance carriers marketing efforts by provide them with insights into what markets they can cut ad spending. This cut in ad spending could be forwarded to customers in other markets in the form of premium reduction. 

## The Problem Area

My area of interest is property & casualty insurance (insurance associated with property and liability). This project could have broad implications as there are multiple lines and types of insurance with varying challenges. However, for this project I will narrow the scope to personal lines auto insurance, which contains policies that are purchased and held by a common person for their personal/private automobile. The challenges and/or opportunities my project would be to identify what demographics in a customer influences them retaining their auto insurance policy. My project’s insights can be used by insurance carriers to identfy markets of focus based on demographics associated with high-rsik of churn. For example, they can calibrate underwritten premium for certain customers that have high churn demographics in order to retain them. If an insurance carrier successfully retains customers, they can choose to spending less on ads as they do not need to be concerned with replacing customers due to churn. These ad savings can also be passed on to customers in the form of a premium decrease. 

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from **Kaggle**, a prominent platform for public and paid datasets. See the data dictionary below for information regarding columns in the dataset and the row values they carry.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### ➡️ Data Cleaning
Data cleaning consists of removing irrelevant features, handling null/missing data, converting features into appropriate dtypes and checking for duplicate data. 

### 🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA will help the understanding of feature distributions and relationships retention and/or churn. This understanding will in turn idenfity ideal model choise and guide feature engineering.

## Impact
I anticipate my project to add value in both the business and societal sense. Where insurance carriers can increase customer retention by 5% allowing for a reduction in add spending by 10% or $165,000,000. These saves in ad spending can be passed on to customers in the form of a reduction in annual premium by 4%. If we are the considering national average cost of $2,150 annually, we would see cost be reduced to $2,064. It may not seemm like a large amount of savings, but if the machine learning from this project can be adopted by all insruance carriers that carry personal auto insurance, then this savings can be felt by the ~232.8 million licensed drivers in the United States.
