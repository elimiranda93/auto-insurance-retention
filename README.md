# Auto Insurance Retention Capstone

</div>

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that will identify the likelihood of customer retention based on aspects of their demographic. Identifying aspects of customer demographics associated with increased retention will help to guide insurance carriers' marketing efforts by providing them with insights into what markets they can cut ad spending. This cut in ad spending could be forwarded to customers in other markets in the form of a premium reduction. 

## The Problem Area

My area of interest is property & casualty insurance (insurance associated with property and liability). This project could have broad implications as there are multiple lines and types of insurance with varying challenges. However, for this project I will narrow the scope to personal lines' auto insurance, which contains policies that are purchased and held by a common person for their personal/private automobile. The challenges and/or opportunities in my project would be to identify what demographics in a customer influence them to retain their auto insurance policy. My project’s insights can be used by insurance carriers to identify markets of focus based on demographics associated with high-risk of churn. For example, they can calibrate underwritten premiums for certain customers that have high churn demographics in order to retain them. If an insurance carrier successfully retains customers, they can choose to spend less on ads as they do not need to be concerned with replacing customers due to churn. These ad savings can also be passed on to customers in the form of a premium decrease. 

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from **Kaggle**, a prominent platform for public and paid datasets. See the data dictionary below for information regarding columns in the dataset and the row values they carry.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### ➡️ Data Cleaning
Data cleaning consists of removing irrelevant features, handling null/missing data, converting features into appropriate dtypes and checking for duplicate data. Clean data can be found in the following link(see the file with 'clean' in its name):https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tK2drVlQC_fwGeblF-jODaq3gtiQxPOo?usp=sharing

### 🕵️‍♂️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA will help the understanding of feature distributions and relationship retention and/or churn. This understanding will in turn identify the ideal model choices and guide feature engineering.

## Impact
I anticipate my project will add value in both the business and societal sense. Where insurance carriers can increase customer retention by 5% allowing for a reduction in added spending by 10% or $165,000,000. These savings in ad spending can be passed on to customers in the form of a reduction in the annual premium by 4%. If we are considering the national average cost of $2,150 annually, we would see the cost be reduced to $2,064. It may not seem like a large amount of savings, but if the machine learning from this project can be adopted by all insurance carriers that carry personal auto insurance, then these savings can be felt by the ~232.8 million licensed drivers in the United States.
